However, 
Lily soon discovers that the town hides a dark past. Years ago, a local priest went mad and committed a series of ritualistic murders before mysteriously disappearing.
Stories about the "Sacrificer" have become legends used to scare children, but Lily realizes something much more sinister is at 
 play when they find Sarah (Ariana Grande) and Billy (Ethan Slater) brutally killed in acts that mimic ancient rituals.
 With the help of her new group of friends, Sofia (Mia Goth), Jack (Timoth√©e Chalamet) Olivia (avantika vandanapu) Emma (Zendaya) and Noah (Jack Champion), 
Lily then begins to investigate the return of the "sacrificer", while new sacrifices are made..</p>
